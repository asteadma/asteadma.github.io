        My name is Alex! This is my second semester at City College of San Francisco and I've lived in the city for six years.  My main hobby is bicycles, both riding and working on. I grew up in Phoenix so I love how this city is the opposite of that city in just about every possible way.

        I'm in this class as I'm planning on getting into Front End Web Development. As I mentioned I like tinkering with bikes and other mechanical things so web development seems like an extension of that. Many people have also told me I seem like I'd be good for it and they can't all be wrong, right? I'm going to do all I can to hone my skills in hopes of getting a job after I've finished this certification or, if I feel like I still need more practice, attend a boot camp afterward.
